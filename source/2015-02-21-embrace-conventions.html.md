Rails and Ember both are opinionated frameworks. These opinions are based around conventions that make us extremely productive. As Rails developers we know this first hand. When learning Rails, you may have found yourself struggling to learn something. Only later did you realize that there was a far easier way to do it. A “Rails way”. While learning Ember, you’ll find the same to be true.

Here’s a piece of advice that might save some frustration for you. If something is really hard, or you’re writing lots of code to make it work, there is probably a better way. An “Ember way”. The Ember community is extremely helpful, so hop on the [Discourse forum](http://discuss.emberjs.com/), #emberjs on freenode, or [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ember.js) and someone is bound to help you out pretty quickly.
